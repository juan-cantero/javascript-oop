// objects in javascript are dynamic that means you can add properties in the fly

export let dog = {
    name:"blue"
};

// for instance dog.bark = function() {console.log('woof')};
// also we can delete properties with delete dog.bark

//it is posible to access to properties with [] like this
// dog['name']
